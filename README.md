# Why everyone on GitHub use Linux (WEOGHULNUX)
Really, why?

Linux has less security, too. 

Run the shell file named `deldl.sh` in root directory of this repository. It will deletes all files in your Downloads.

Run the shell file named `renf.sh` in root directory of this repository. It will change all of the files format in Desktop to `.linuxisnotsecure`

Run the Python file named `notsec.py` in root directory of this repository. It will run both shell files

This is why I don't like Linux.

No Microsoft Office! No Photoshop! No Premiere Pro! Nothing avaliable for Linux! Alternatives can't replace the real software!
